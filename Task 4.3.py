### Task 4.3
# File `data/students.csv` stores information about students in [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format.
# This file contains the studentâ€™s names, age and average mark. 
# 1) Implement a function which receives file path and returns names of top performer students
# ```python
# def get_top_performers(file_path, number_of_top_students=5):
#    pass
# print(get_top_performers("students.csv"))
# >>> ['Teresa Jones', 'Richard Snider', 'Jessica Dubose', 'Heather Garcia', 'Joseph Head']
#```

#2) Implement a function which receives the file path with srudents info and writes CSV student information to the new file in descending order of age. 
#Result:
#``` 
#student name,age,average mark
#Verdell Crawford,30,8.86
#Brenda Silva,30,7.53
#...
#Lindsey Cummings,18,6.88
#Raymond Soileau,18,7.27
#```
