### Task 4.7*
# Run the module `modules/mod_a.py`. Check its result. Explain why does this happen.
# Try to change x to a list `[1,2,3]`. Explain the result.
#   in order for the changes to have an effect changes should be made in mod_b. The reason is the order of importing.
#   so if we change value in mod_c so then next step is reriting of its value on importing of mod_b.

# Try to change import to `from x import *` where x - module names. Explain the result. 
#  can't explain right now, may be in later commits )))
